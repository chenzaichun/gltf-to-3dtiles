# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: windows-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    - uses: microsoft/setup-msbuild@v1.0.0
